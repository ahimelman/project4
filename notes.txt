spawn: pcb
do_mbox: bounded buffer, in book

just have processes in kernel
kernel has fixed array of PCBs, search through 
pid can be monotonically increasing, or index of PCB in array

kernel.c has things to allocate stack, but it's not entirely right (stack_new)

message boxes: bounded buffer problem in book
create array, semaphore, with each message box

KEYBOARD INPUT
- putchar is producer, if buffer is full, discard what you're trying to put in, don't block
- getchar is consumer

when kill process, have to decrement ref counts in message boxes

wait: condition variables

poop
